# 🌍 Hierarchical Clustering – Environmental & Socioeconomic Analysis

This project applies **Hierarchical Clustering** to environmental and socioeconomic variables to identify natural groupings among regions or countries.  
By analyzing factors like pollution, resource use, income, education, and development indicators, it reveals similarities, disparities, and pattern trends, supporting sustainability insights and policy planning.

---

## 🌱 Project Objective
Use hierarchical clustering to discover hidden structure and relationships within datasets combining:
- Environmental metrics  
- Social and living condition indicators  
- Economic growth and development variables

---

## 🧬 Why Hierarchical Clustering?
Hierarchical clustering:
- Captures similarity without pre-defining cluster count
- Provides visual cluster merging using dendrograms
- Helps reveal nested relationships between regions
- Makes clustering easier to interpret than hard partitioning

---

## 📊 Workflow
1. Import and clean dataset  
2. Normalize or scale features  
3. Compute pairwise distances  
4. Apply hierarchical linkage (ward/complete/average)  
5. Plot dendrogram  
6. Assign clusters  
7. Interpret cluster characteristics

---

## 📈 Visualizations
- **Dendrograms** for hierarchical merging
- **Cluster scatter plots or heatmaps**
- Optional PCA reduction for clearer separation

---

## 🌍 Insights & Use Cases
Hierarchical clustering helps identify:
- Regions with similar pollution & economic trends  
- Countries showing environmental stress but low resources  
- Groups with balanced development and sustainability  
- High-risk vs thriving areas for policy focus  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- NumPy & Pandas  
- SciPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Compare results across multiple linkage methods
- Add PCA/T-SNE for clearer visualization
- Integrate K-Means or DBSCAN for comparison
- Build interactive dashboards via Streamlit/Plotly

## 🏁 Conclusion
Hierarchical clustering is a powerful tool for examining patterns across environmental and socioeconomic indicators.  
By grouping similar regions and exposing differences, the method supports better planning, equitable development, and sustainability-driven decision-making.  
This project demonstrates how unsupervised learning can uncover meaningful structure in complex real-world datasets.
